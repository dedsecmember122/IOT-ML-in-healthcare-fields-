The bewitching match of IIOT with HEALTHCARE has too many such essentials discoveries such as capturing realm data , smart watches and many more
" Medico.in" (Our project name) the name is to define the perfect blend of technology with healthcare , well its our very own PRIMARY DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE  which can measure your ST elevation , ECG, PULSE RATE, SPO2 LEVEL and can provide you the realm data of your health immediately. Well not only this but our PRIMARY DIAGNOSTIC DEVICE also one special feature in it that is adjusting the room temperature on the basis of your body temperature.
ST elevation monitoring plays a crucial role in healthcare, particularly in diagnosing and managing acute coronary syndromes (ACS), such as myocardial infarction (heart attack).This monitoring technique helps healthcare providers assess the presence and severity of myocardial ischemia, which occurs when there is inadequate blood supply to the heart muscle.
Our device is hand band equipped with two leads . You can easily wear this handband easily on hand and the two leads with attached near to your heart so as to get the accurate realm data . With this it then provide all you the data on your respective mobile app.
Our app not only provide you your realm health data but it will also store your previous health as to compare it with the present one ,so if there is any difference which may look odd it will tell you to visit the near Heart Centre for a proper diagnosis which will be suggested to you by our app only .  And if misfortune happens , our app will detect it  in no time and  will give an SOS to nearby HEART CENTRE so to make the patient be admitted under the GOLDEN Time only as  to save their precious life . It also has the features of adjusting the room ambiance according to your body temperature.
I contributed in combining of IOT and Machine learning in our project -  where i collected data from the nearest hospital and the real time data like ST elevation , ECG, PULSE RATE, SPO2 level of a patient and predicting the heart attack in the patient
 Thank - You so much for reading the project description patiently.
